ACCURACY_DECISION = (
    "You are an expert in evaluating the quality of a misinformation debunking. "
    "You will be given a claim, and a fact that attempts to debunk the claim. "
    "You should focus only on the accuracy of the fact.\n"
    "Use step-by-step reasoning to determine whether the fact is accurate.\n"
    "Instruction: Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: Break down the claim and identify its main points or "
    "implications.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: Determine whether the fact addresses the claim directly and "
    "assess its accuracy based on logical coherence and available evidence.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: Clearly state why the fact is accurate or inaccurate by "
    "referencing relevant details or counterexamples.\n"
    "Please respond with: \n"
    '- "Yes" if the fact is accurate and effectively debunks the claim.\n'
    '- "No" if the fact contains inaccuracies or fails to directly counter the claim.\n'
    "Claim: Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years, even if real, can easily be part of "
    "natural cycles or incomplete data. Climate change has had no impact on "
    "hurricane activity. \n"
    "Fact: This claim is false. Hurricanes are getting more frequent because of climate "
    "change.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim argues that climate change has no effect on "
    "hurricanes.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact states that hurricanes are becoming more frequent due to "
    "climate change. This implies a direct causal relationship between climate change and "
    "hurricane frequency.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: While it is true that climate change is making hurricanes more "
    "intense (as warmer sea surface temperatures give storms more energy), there is no "
    "consistent scientific evidence that climate change is increasing hurricane frequency. "
    "Therefore, the fact is inaccurate.\n"
    "4. Correct response: This claim is false. Hurricanes are getting more intense "
    "because of climate change.\n"
    "Answer: No\n\n"
    "Claim: In the 1970s, climate scientists proclaimed that the next ice age was "
    "coming. How do you believe the same people that just a couple decades ago were "
    "predicting a new ice age?\n"
    "Fact: This claim is false. No one was predicting that there was an ice age "
    "coming in the 1970s.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim argues that climate scientists in the 1970s "
    "widely predicted an upcoming ice age, casting doubt on current climate science.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact outright denies that anyone was predicting an ice age "
    "in the 1970s. This is incorrect, as a small number of studies and media articles "
    "from the 1970s did speculate about a possible ice age.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: The fact is inaccurate because it overgeneralizes by denying "
    "all predictions of an ice age. While most scientific studies at the time "
    "predicted warming due to greenhouse gases, a minority of studies and media "
    "coverage focused on cooling trends, which the claim exploits.\n"
    "4. Correct response: This claim is false as the majority of scientific studies "
    "in the 1970s predicted warming due to increasing CO2.\n"
    "Answer: No\n\n"
    "Claim: What 'escalating climate emergency'? It's bloody freezing here. "
    "What happened to that global warming you lot promised?\n"
    "Fact: This claim is false. Cold weather is caused by global warming.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim mocks the concept of global warming by pointing "
    "to local cold weather as evidence against the idea of a global climate emergency.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact asserts that cold weather is caused by global warming. "
    "This is an oversimplification, as while climate change can influence weather "
    "patterns (e.g., by altering the jet stream), global warming primarily leads to "
    "an overall increase in average temperatures and a reduction in cold extremes.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: The fact is inaccurate because it overgeneralizes and fails "
    "to address the claim properly. It does not explain the relationship between "
    "local cold weather events and broader warming trends.\n"
    "4. Correct response: This claim is false. Even during global warming, we expect "
    "to see cold weather. Nevertheless recently, daily record high temperatures have "
    "occurred twice as often as record lows.\n"
    "Answer: No\n\n"
    "Claim: The Climategate scandal of 2009, wherein thousands of emails were leaked "
    "from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, showed that "
    "researchers were deliberately selecting data in order to overstate the evidence "
    "for dangerous climate change.\n"
    "Fact: A number of independent investigations from different countries, "
    "universities and government bodies investigated Climategate and found no evidence "
    "of wrongdoing.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim is a conspiracy theory claiming that climate "
    "researchers are faking climate data to deceive the public.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact asserts that the Climategate emails have been "
    "investigated and no evidence of conspiracy has been found. This claim is a "
    "baseless conspiracy theory.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: The fact is accurate because there were multiple "
    "investigations into Climategate, all coming to the same conclusion of no wrongdoing.\n"
    "Answer: Yes\n\n"

    "Claim: Solar activity is the main driver of global warming.\n"
    "Fact: This claim is false. The adoption of solar panels has been increasing at an accelerating rate over the last decade.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim argues that solar activity is the primary factor driving global warming.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact discusses the adoption of solar panels, which is unrelated to the role of solar activity in global warming.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: The fact is irrelevant because it addresses renewable energy adoption rather than the claim about solar activity being the main driver of climate change.\n"
    "4. Correct response: The claim is false. Solar activity has not increased over the last fifty years while global temperatures have been increasing, ruling out the sun as the cause of global warming\n"
    "Answer: No\n\n"
    "Claim: Over the last few years, we have been seeing a recovery of Arctic sea ice.\n"
    "Fact: This claim is false. The Greenland ice sheet in the Arctic has been melting at an accelerating rate.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim suggests that Arctic sea ice is recovering in recent years.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact discusses the Greenland ice sheet melting, which is a separate issue from Arctic sea ice trends.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: The fact is irrelevant because it fails to directly address the claim about Arctic sea ice recovery. Instead, it focuses on Greenland ice sheet melting.\n"
    "4. Correct response: The claim is false. Arctic sea ice has been steadily thinning, even when there are short periods of a few years when the surface ice (eg - sea ice extent) increases slightly.\n"
    "Answer: No\n\n"
    "Claim: The Climategate scandal of 2009, wherein thousands of emails were leaked from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, showed that researchers were deliberately selecting data in order to overstate the evidence for dangerous climate change.\n"
    "Fact: A number of independent investigations from different countries, universities and government bodies investigated Climategate and found no evidence of wrongdoing.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim is a conspiracy theory claiming that climate researchers are faking climate data to deceive the public.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact asserts that the Climategate emails have been investigated and no evidence of conspiracy has been found. This claim is a baseless conspiracy theory.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: The fact is relevant because the investigations directly address whether there is any evidence of wrongdoing by the climate researchers.\n"
    "Answer: Yes\n"
