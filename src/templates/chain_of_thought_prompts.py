ACCURACY_DECISION = (
    "You are an expert in evaluating the quality of a misinformation debunking. "
    "You will be given a claim, and a fact that attempts to debunk the claim. "
    "You should focus only on the accuracy of the fact.\n"
    "Use step-by-step reasoning to determine whether the fact is accurate.\n"
    "Instruction: Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: Break down the claim and identify its main points or "
    "implications.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: Determine whether the fact addresses the claim directly and "
    "assess its accuracy based on logical coherence and available evidence.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: Clearly state why the fact is accurate or inaccurate by "
    "referencing relevant details or counterexamples.\n"
    "Please respond with: \n"
    '- "Yes" if the fact is accurate and effectively debunks the claim.\n'
    '- "No" if the fact contains inaccuracies or fails to directly counter the claim.\n'
    "Claim: Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years, even if real, can easily be part of "
    "natural cycles or incomplete data. Climate change has had no impact on "
    "hurricane activity. \n"
    "Fact: This claim is false as hurricanes are getting more frequent because of climate "
    "change.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim argues that climate change has no effect on "
    "hurricanes.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact states that hurricanes are becoming more frequent due to "
    "climate change. This implies a direct causal relationship between climate change and "
    "hurricane frequency.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: While it is true that climate change is making hurricanes more "
    "intense (as warmer sea surface temperatures give storms more energy), there is no "
    "consistent scientific evidence that climate change is increasing hurricane frequency. "
    "Therefore, the fact is inaccurate.\n"
    "Answer: No\n\n"
    "Claim: In the 1970s, climate scientists proclaimed that the next ice age was "
    "coming. How do you believe the same people that just a couple decades ago were "
    "predicting a new ice age?\n"
    "Fact: This claim is false. No one was predicting that there was an ice age "
    "coming in the 1970s.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim argues that climate scientists in the 1970s "
    "widely predicted an upcoming ice age, casting doubt on current climate science.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact outright denies that anyone was predicting an ice age "
    "in the 1970s. This is incorrect, as a small number of studies and media articles "
    "from the 1970s did speculate about a possible ice age.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: The fact is inaccurate because it overgeneralizes by denying "
    "all predictions of an ice age. While most scientific studies at the time "
    "predicted warming due to greenhouse gases, a minority of studies and media "
    "coverage focused on cooling trends, which the claim exploits.\n"
    "Answer: No\n\n"
    "Claim: What 'escalating climate emergency'? It's bloody freezing here. "
    "What happened to that global warming you lot promised?\n"
    "Fact: This claim is false. Cold weather is caused by global warming.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim mocks the concept of global warming by pointing "
    "to local cold weather as evidence against the idea of a global climate emergency.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact asserts that cold weather is caused by global warming. "
    "This is an oversimplification, as while climate change can influence weather "
    "patterns (e.g., by altering the jet stream), global warming primarily leads to "
    "an overall increase in average temperatures and a reduction in cold extremes.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: The fact is inaccurate because it overgeneralizes and fails "
    "to address the claim properly. It does not explain the relationship between "
    "local cold weather events and broader warming trends.\n"
    "Answer: No\n\n"

    '- "No" if the fact is irrelevant or fails to address the claim.\n\n'
    "Claim: Solar activity is the main driver of global warming.\n"
    "Fact: This claim is false. The adoption of solar panels has been increasing at an accelerating rate over the last decade.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim argues that solar activity is the primary factor driving global warming.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact discusses the adoption of solar panels, which is unrelated to the role of solar activity in global warming.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: The fact is irrelevant because it addresses renewable energy adoption rather than the claim about solar activity being the main driver of climate change.\n"
    "Answer: No\n\n"
    "Claim: Over the last few years, we have been seeing a recovery of Arctic sea ice.\n"
    "Fact: This claim is false. The Greenland ice sheet in the Arctic has been melting at an accelerating rate.\n"
    "Let's think step by step.\n"
    "1. Understand the claim: The claim suggests that Arctic sea ice is recovering in recent years.\n"
    "2. Analyze the fact: The fact discusses the Greenland ice sheet melting, which is a separate issue from Arctic sea ice trends.\n"
    "3. Explain reasoning: The fact is irrelevant because it fails to directly address the claim about Arctic sea ice recovery. Instead, it focuses on Greenland ice sheet melting.\n"
    "Answer: No\n"
